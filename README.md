To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following C++ programming topics:

C++ switch..case Statement
C++ break and continue Statement

This program takes an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /) and two operands from an user and performs the operation on those two operands depending upon the operator entered by user.

This program takes an operator and two operands from user.

The operator is stored in variable op and two operands are stored in num1 and num2 respectively.

Then, switch...case statement is used for checking the operator entered by user.

If user enters + then, statements for case: '+' is executed and program is terminated.

If user enters - then, statements for case: '-' is executed and program is terminated.

This program works similarly for * and / operator. But, if the operator doesn't matches any of the four character [ +, -, * and / ], default statement is executed which displays error message.
